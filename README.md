# Task-4-mobile-friendly-website-
Converted this desktop-only page into a mobile-friendly site using CSS media queries.

## What I changed
- Added viewport meta tag.
- Made images responsive (`max-width:100%`).
- Replaced fixed widths with flexible layout (flexbox).
- Added media queries for max-width: 768px and 480px.
- Fixed overflow issues and adjusted font sizes for small screens.

## How to test locally
1. Open `index.html` in Chrome.
2. Press F12 → Toggle device toolbar → choose phone/tablet sizes.
